      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump’s ex-national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI in January.</p>
<p>Mr Flynn was forced to resign the following month after misleading the White House about meeting the Russian ambassador before Mr Trump took office.</p>
<p>The charges were brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of his investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election.<br>Mr Flynn arrived at court on Friday.<br><a id="more"></a><br>He admitted to one count of knowingly making “false, fictitious and fraudulent statements”.</p>
<p>According to an AFP reporter, Mr Flynn was asked by Judge Rudolph Contreras if he wished to plead guilty and responded with the words “Yes, sir”. The judge continued: “I accept your guilty plea. There will be no trial and there will be probably no appeal.”</p>
<p>A short time later he issued a statement in which he said “I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right”.</p>
<p>The former aide is the most senior member of the Trump administration so far to have been indicted by the Mueller investigation.</p>
<p>In October, Mr Trump’s former presidential campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was accused of conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine. It also emerged that another ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, had pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents.</p>
